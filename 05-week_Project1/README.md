## Project 1 : Due March 4

One of artâ€™s agreed upon purposes is to make visible the invisible, to shed light on something in the dark, to speak when there is silence. For project 1, create a series of images (collage, photo, text or some combination) that speaks to a topic which you feel strongly about. Please put this together in the form of a zine or multi-page print document. Print and "bind" three to bring to the crit next week. 

Requirements:
- Project Proposal (due by today):
  - Project description - conceptual and visual plan
  - Execution plan (deliverables organized by date)
- Print and assembled 3 copies of your zine before class on March 4
- At least 6 pages total
- Have your name and title incorporated somewhere

## Homework
- Finish Project 1 and print 3 copies
- If you are presenting next time we meet, send me your topic this week sometime.
