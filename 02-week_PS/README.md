"Since the early 1990s, Mark Dion (b. 1961, New Bedford, MA) has forged a unique, interdisciplinary practice by exploring and appropriating scientific methodologies. Often with an edge of irony, humor, and improvisation, Dion deconstructs both scientific and museum-based rituals of collecting and exhibiting objects by critically adopting them into his artistic practice."

## In-Class Assignment
- Create three collages, each is focused on a different aspect of unity addressed in the reading.
  - Proximity
  - Repetition
  - Continuation
  - Continuity (if you want to use this through all three)
  - Variety

## Homework Assignment
- Take two photographs with your phone or camera. Continue to uses concepts we learned about unity when framing and composing your images. Using adjustments in photoshop, alter how the image is read or perceived. Tell one truth and one fiction. You can make drastic or subtle changes to make one image ring more true, and to manipulate the other to be less true. This assignment is based on Practices of Looking. We will look at these in class next week. You will turn in four files, two originals and two edits.
