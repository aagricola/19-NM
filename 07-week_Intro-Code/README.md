## Generative Art
Generative art refers to any art practice where the artist creates a process, such as a set of natural language rules, a computer program, a machine, or other procedural invention, which is then set into motion with some degree of autonomy contributing to or resulting in a completed work of art. -Wikipedia

Bruce Nauman, Body Pressure, 1974
“Press as much of the front surface of your body (palms in or out, left or right cheek) against the wall as possible. Press very hard and concentrate. Form an image of yourself (suppose you had just stepped forward) on the opposite side of the wall pressing back against the wall very hard. Press very hard and concentrate on the image pressing very hard. (the image of pressing very hard) Press your front surface and back surface toward each other and begin to

## Poetic Computation

*“A computer is nothing more than a machine that is brilliant at following precise instructions, but knows nothing about the world at large. And this is where we begin our journey, our story, our new life as a programmer. We begin with learning how to talk to our friend, the computer.”* -Daniel Shiffman

And we talk to the computer using coded instructions called an algorithm. It is nothing more than a detailed instruction. While the word algorithm is usually used in the realm of computers, you could call any precise explanation of how to do something an algorithm - a baking recipe, knitting instruction, driving directions, ect. ignore or block the thickness of the wall. (remove the wall).”

*"The main challenge is trying to create work that touches people at an emotional level, as opposed to them thinking about the technology or wondering how it was made. Making poems, not demos, is how we refer to it, i.e. making work that is like a poem, short yet dense, re-tellable, rhythmic, meaningful as opposed to a demo that just feels like technology for technology's sake. "*    -Zach Lieberman

*"Code can be a source of inspiration and it can help create previously unimaginable forms."*   - Casey Reas & Chandler Mcwilliams

[Augmented Hand Series](http://www.flong.com/projects/augmented-hand-series/) is a real-time interactive software system that presents playful, dreamlike, and uncanny transformations of its visitors’ hands; by by Golan Levin, Chris Sugrue, and Kyle McDonald

### Why should I learn to code?

 - Learning to code allows you to build your very own tools instead of using someone else's
 - Gateway to realizing new forms
 - Learn to see systems in everyday life
 - Learn to code, less be coded:

 [Douglas Rushoff SXSW Lecture "Code or Be Coded"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imV3pPIUy1k)

### Why should I learn coding with Processing?

 - Processing is intuitive and visually responsive language to learn to code in
 - Learning through immediate visual feedback! (text in —> visuals out)
 - Processing is a fully functional programming language —> built on Java
 - FREE — Open Source (lots of online resources for learning)
 - Its simplicity is ideal for the beginners

## Homework
- If you are presenting next time we meet, send me your topic this week sometime.
- Finish Processing Sketch
- Begin to think about Project 2

## Project 2
Using any combination of skills developed in class and through personal research, design a **system** that investigates, comments on, or even disrupts a technology, social system, cultural algorithm, or codes that are at work on a micro and macro scale in our world/society. Feel free to work in pairs.
Required:
- Write an instruction that you or your user follows in order to generate the work.
- Use photoshop, illustrator, premier, and/or processing to document the evolution
- Start early and work gradually so that you have time to collect data
- Project Proposal (due April 8):
  - Project description - conceptual and visual plan
  - Execution plan (deliverables organized by date)

## Timeline for Remainder of Semester:

- April 1: Continue w/ Processing
- April 8: Turn in proposal, intro to video editing with Premier
- April 15: Show progress on Project 2; intro to sound and video effects & Mad Mapper
- April 22: Project 2 Work day
- April 29: Critique
- May 6: One-on-one meetings / followup / All documentation due
