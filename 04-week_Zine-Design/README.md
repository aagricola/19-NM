## [How To Make A Zine](https://issuu.com/limurray7/docs/scan)

- Please explore some more zines that I have brought to class with me and on issuu (in the link above) for inspiration for your assignment and projects.

## InDesign Assignment

Create a layout for your two truths and a fiction homework.

##Illustrator Assignment

Drawing upon your reading as a source of inspiration, use Illustrator to create a work of word art. Feel free to use text in combination with a collage or image you have previously made.

## Project 1 : Due March 4

One of art’s agreed upon purposes is to make visible the invisible, to shed light on something in the dark, to speak when there is silence. For project 1, create a series of images (collage, photo, text or some combination) that speaks to a topic which you feel strongly about. Please put this together in the form of a zine or multi-page print document.

Requirements:
- Project Proposal (due by next class):
  - Project description - conceptual and visual plan
  - Execution plan (deliverables organized by date)
- Printed and assembled before class on March 4
- At least 6 pages total

## Homework
- Finish Assignment 3
- Work on Project 1 over the break
  - send me your project proposal by next class
- If you are presenting next time we meet, send me your topic this week sometime.
