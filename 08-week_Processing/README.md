## Conditional statements

[Douglas Rushoff SXSW Lecture "Code or Be Coded"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imV3pPIUy1k)

Conditionals allow the draw loop to execute differently depending on something that is happening in the code. So the code can take different paths depending on whether certain conditions have been met and return true or false.

Else if statements execute something totally different if the if statement returns false.

We will use operators : && (and) , || (or) , == (equal to), != (not equal to)

We will look at (mousePressed) to check if the user is holding down the mouse. This is different from using events (functions) like function mousePressed() or function keyPressed() which changes a state permanently.

We will use a boolean to create a toggle switch

And a few other things you will find in today's examples:
  - keyboard events
  - pfont
  - export
  - import svg

## Net Art & Non-linear Stories

  “Access to computers and the Internet completely changed the way that I consumed information and organized ideas in my head. I saw information stacked on top of itself in simultaneity, no longer confined to spatiotemporal dimensions of the book.”  – Krystal South , quote from idyrslf.com

  ![zork](https://classicreload.com/sites/default/files/msdos_zork1.jpg)

  **Zork** is one of the earliest interactive fiction computer games, with roots drawn from the original genre game, Colossal Cave Adventure. The first version of Zork was written between 1977 and 1979. The authors—Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling—were members of the MIT Dynamic Modelling Group.

  **olia lialina,_ my boyfriend came back from the war_ (m.b.c.b.f.t.w.)**

  It tells the story of two lovers who reunite after an unspecified conflict. Fragments of dialogue convey the difficulty they have reconnecting, though not explicitly stated. She approaches the web as a medium similar to film. She calls it a netfilm. The flow splits and digresses into multiple threads, similar to a cinematic montage in which separate simultaneous actions are edited to produce the effect of simultaneity.

  **Based in Seoul, South Korea,Young-hae Chang Heavy Industries**, composed of the Korean Young-hae Chang and the American Marc Voge, combine text with jazz music with Flash productions in which they use solely the Monaco font. In these works they are breaking the Internet tendency to emphasize interactivity and foregrounding photo’s, illustrations and excessive use of colors.

  **Shu Lea Cheang, "Brandon", bigdoll interface, collaboration with Jordy Jones and Cherise Fong, 1998**

   Teena Brandon, 21 year old woman who was raped an killed for passing as a man  (movie “Boys Don't Cry” was based on this). Guggenheim Museum commissioned Taiwanese-American artist to explore Teena’s story in a non-linear, experimental way.

![moucheette](http://neddam.info/site/wp-content/gallery/mouchette/mouchette01.jpg)

**Mouchette.org** is an interactive website created in 1996 by a virtual person, a pseudonymous character, an Amsterdam based artist who calls herself Mouchette. With her innocent salutation and claims to be “nearly thirteen” greeting us from the introduction page, what initially appears as a personal website of a pre-pubescent female artist, evolves into darker themes in the subsequent pages.
The creator of the website has been a closely guarded secret. While the use of taboo subject matters are what initially provokes heated reactions, the manipulation of cyber-identity and the ability of the creator to maintain anonymity for so long are the significant reasons this website has garnered its international reputation in the internet art community.

## Assignment
Non-linear story
Using the skills we have learned in class so far, create a Non-linear story about an experience you have had.


## Homework:

- Finish your non-linear narrative assignment
- Project Proposal (put it in your respective folder)
- Optional: Review conditional logic with [Daniel Shiffman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVq7Ms01RjA&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6YqykuLs00261JCqnL_NNZ_&index=2)
- Optional: we will not be doing this in class, but you may find it useful if you want to continue programming with Processing to [Learn about Functions from Daniel Shiffman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCu7JSkgl04&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ajGB2OI3hl5DZsD1Fw1WzR&index=1)

## Project 2
Using any combination of skills developed in class and through personal research, design a **system** that investigates, comments on, or even disrupts a technology, social system, cultural algorithm, or codes that are at work on a micro and macro scale in our world/society. Feel free to work in pairs.
Required:
- Write an instruction that you or your user follows in order to generate the work.
- Use photoshop, illustrator, premier, and/or processing to document the evolution
- Start early and work gradually so that you have time to collect data
- Project Proposal (due April 8):
  - Project description - conceptual and visual plan
  - Execution plan (deliverables organized by date)

## Timeline for Remainder of Semester:

- April 1: Continue w/ Processing
- April 8: Turn in proposal, intro to video editing with Premier
- April 15: Show progress on Project 2; intro to sound and video effects & Mad Mapper
- April 22: Project 2 Work day
- April 29: Critique
- May 6: One-on-one meetings / followup / All documentation due
