## COURSE DESCRIPTION
 New Media is designed to introduce you to a wide variety of digital tools and resources that support emerging (as well as traditional) forms of art and design. Over the course of the semester, we will examine the meaning of a digital practice by investigating tools and techniques, examining the historical and contemporary practice of artists and designers who work with creative technology, and analyzing the role of media production and consumption in contemporary culture.

## Important Things to Remember
 - Help is always a click away; via the internet, your peers, or emailing me. Remember to do homework ahead of time so that you can get questions to me 48 hours before class.
 - Mistakes are great ways to learn. Be courageous, fail flamboyantly, and know that you tried your best. Don't let fear or mistakes stand in your way of learning and creating.
 - Participation is integral to this class's culture. This also means coming prepared to all of the classes, do the homework, and be engaged.
 -  Share what you learn along the way and collaborate with your peers. We are embodying an open source education model.
 - You get one unexcused absence, the next diminishes your grade and the third gets an F. Please provide me with a doctors note if you are sick. Talk to me if you have an extended leave of absence.
