## Video Art // Video Collage

[Joan Jonas, Volcanic Saga, 1989](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdSEpXrw8vY)
Joan Jonas is an American pioneer of video and performance art; one of the most important female artists of the 60s and 70s.
In this video, actors are cut and pasted over scenes of Icelandic landscapes tell an Icelandic folktale about a woman named Gudrun whose adventures revolved around four mysterious dreams that required the services of a soothsayer. Projections of Iceland's otherworldly landscape furnished a visual backdrop.

[Hermine Freed, Art Herstory, 1974](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vC1y6fLLY0)

 Freed has restaged art history, putting herself in the model’s role in numerous paintings.... Time dissolves under her humorous assault — one moment in the painting, then out of the canvas and into that period, then back in the studio.

[Vicki Bennett, The End of the Sound of Music](http://peoplelikeus.org/2011/the-sound-of-the-end-of-music/)
"Since 1991 British artist Vicki Bennett has been working across the field of audio-visual collage, and is recognised as an influential and pioneering figure in the still growing area of sampling, appropriation and cutting up of found footage and archives. Working under the name People Like Us, Vicki specialises in the manipulation and reworking of original sources from both the experimental and popular worlds of music, film and radio. People Like Us believe in open access to archives for creative use. "

[Pipilotti Rist, I'm a Victim of this Song, 1995](http://www.ubu.com/film/rist_victim.html)

"With I'm a Victim of this Song, Rist takes up the concept of the "cover" version, in which one performer does a version of another's song, and gives it her own twist. Starting with music from Chris Isaak's hit single Wicked Game, she adds her own sung and screamed versions of the lyrics, accompanied by effects-manipulated, diaristic video images. The result is an art-world "cover" of a popular artifact, with a woman's voice reinterpreting the male original, and a vivid illustration of the consumer's claim to own and interpret media images."

[Camille Henrot "Grosse Fatigue"](https://vimeo.com/86174818)
"Trying to com-prehend (to comprehend = to grasp) an infinite mass of information that, by definition, will forever remain in excess in the span of thirteen minutes is an exercise that falls within the bounds of what Walter Benjamin, using psychiatric terms, called a “cataloguing psychosis”. "

[Jon Rafman, "Kool-Aid Man in Second Life Tour"](https://vimeo.com/4870055)
"When our lives become unmanageable, we turn to whatever we can find to try and regain control. For some that is drug addiction, self-harm, or hurting others, but there are hundreds of millions of people who have found catharsis and control in games. " -Krystal South

[Jeremy Bailey, "Don't Mouse Around"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fys_OccfbX8)
"As a self-proclaimed “Famous New Media Artist” and Head of Experience at FreshBooks, a startup on a mission to reshape the world for the self-employed, I believe that technology, creatively misused, empowers us all to be famous. " []-Jeremy Bailey](https://www.jeremybailey.net/)

[Arthur Jaffa, Love is the message, the message is Death excerpt](https://vimeo.com/312673757)

"“Love is the Message, The Message is Death” Set to the searing highs and lows of Kanye West’s gospel-inspired hip-hop track, “Ultralight Beam,” Love Is The Message is a masterful convergence of found footage that traces African-American identity through a vast spectrum of contemporary imagery. From photographs of civil rights leaders watermarked with “Getty Images” to helicopter views of the LA Riots to a wave of bodies dancing to “The Dougie,” the meticulously edited 7-minute video suspends viewers in a swelling, emotional montage that is a testament to Jafa’s profound ability to mine, scrutinize, and reclaim media’s representational modes and strategies. Alongside segments of familiar Black icons and historic events are also scenes featuring lesser known figures: anonymous bodies in various states of elation and despair. Excerpts from Jafa’s own stunning documentary film, Dreams are Colder than Death (2012) inflects a personal dimension to imagery mostly drawn from news media, television and the Internet. In this pointed inclusion, Jafa discloses both his vulnerability and authority as an artist—what it means to contribute to the vast and complex terrain of Black representation. While Love Is The Message poignantly embodies the artist’s desire to create a cinema that “replicates the power, beauty and alienation of Black Music,” it is also a reminder that the collective multitude defining Blackness is comprised of singular individuals, manifold identities and their unaccountable differences." - [MOCA](https://www.moca.org/exhibition/arthur-jafa-love-is-the-message-the-message-is-death)

## Assignment

**Collect Video footage**

- you can use pre exisiting videos you might have
- Go out and shoot new footage with your phone
- AND/OR download some from the internet
  - if the site where the video is hosted offers downloading, use it
  - otherwise, utilize a helper website to download the mp4 file
  - there are hundreds out there; just avoid anything that seems sketchy and don’t download anything other than a video file
  - [here is one I have used in the past](https://www.onlinevideoconverter.com/youtube-converter)
- Create a video collage in Premier. You could explore a particular subject matter or make a purely aesthetic exploration of form and color in motion. This is meant to be a way of learning and exploring the features of Adobe Premier. So try creating layers, try some effects and have fun with it!


## Homework:

- Finish video collage & add sound if you have not already
- Work on Project 2
- Watch [Lynda: Premier Pro Essential Training. Chapters 4-7 & 10](https://www.lynda.com/Premiere-Pro-tutorials/Welcome/758639/808536-4.html) (some of this will be review but she will go more in depth in certain topics that we did not cover)

## Project 2
Using any combination of skills developed in class and through personal research, design a **system** that investigates, comments on, or even disrupts a technology, social system, cultural algorithm, or codes that are at work on a micro and macro scale in our world/society. Feel free to work in pairs.
Required:
- Write an instruction that you or your user follows in order to generate the work.
