People Like Us, Gone Gone Beyond, 2018

"Gone, Gone Beyond is an immersive a/v spatial cinema work by People Like Us, which breaks the rectangle, smashing the thin screen into tiny fragments, looking beyond the frame, climbing through to see whatâ€™s behind.  It uses appropriated edited collage sewn together in a giant patchwork. Pull on a thread and watch whole new narratives expand and unravel all at once on a 360 palette."

Technology has helped set new condition for perception and society which calls us to rethink the body.
- post-Humanity
- technology as body prosthetic
- media as extension of itself

Art participate in this discussion by using electronic and digital technologies in experiments aimed to unsettle the audience's perceptual habits and social behaviors

Development of projecting techniques since the 80s has made it possible to vary the appearance of the image and the involvement of the viewer.

Tony Oursler is a classic example of going beyond the framed screen.

"Using new image-processing technology, which at the time allowed for sophisticated photographic, high- resolution manipulation, such as stretching, bowing, and twisting, Oursler began to shape a cast of digital pets or companions. Based on the notion of a caricature, this series references a wide variety of sources, from Harvey Ball's 1969 smiley face, to the fertility goddess Venus of Wilendorff and Japanese manga. The often overtly humorous, somewhat grotesque characters attempt to seduce the viewer in various ways. For the texts, Oursler listened carefully to the way people speak to pets as well as to "pillow talk" and attempted to fuse the vulnerable, often embarrassing, private language of intimacy into the performances. Monosyllabic and moronic, the caricatures are often unsettling and provoke embarrassment in the viewer."

- visitors performative role
- spatial expansion
